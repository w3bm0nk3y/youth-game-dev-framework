# Roblox Publishing

## Overview
Publishing makes your game available to the world (or just your friends). It's exciting — you're sharing something YOU made!

## First-Time Publishing

3. Click **Create**

### Step 2: Game Settings
Go to **Game Settings** (Home tab in Studio) and configure:

#### Basic Info

  [What makes it special]

  Built at a weekend hackathon!
  ```
