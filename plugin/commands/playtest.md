# /playtest — Guided Playtesting Session

Walk the developer through a structured playtesting session. Keep the tone supportive — finding issues is GOOD, it means we can make the game better!

## Before You Start
Say: "Time to test your game! Let's make sure it's awesome. Publish to Roblox first (File > Publish to Roblox), then open it on your iPad."

## Checklist — Walk Through Each Item

### 1. Does It Load?
- [ ] Game loads without errors in the Output window
- [ ] No red error messages appear
- Ask: "Does your game load up? Any error messages?"

### 2. First 10 Seconds
- [ ] Player can see what they need to do
- [ ] There are visual cues (arrows, signs, colors, UI text)
- Ask: "If a brand new player joined, would they know what to do?"

### 3. Core Mechanic
- [ ] The main gameplay action works
- [ ] It feels responsive (no big delays)
- [ ] It's clear when you succeed or fail
- Ask: "Does the main thing in your game work? Try it a few times."

### 4. No Soft Locks
- [ ] Player can't get stuck with no way to continue
- [ ] Respawning works if you fall or die
- [ ] You can always get back to the main game area
- Ask: "Try to break it! Can you get stuck anywhere?"

### 5. Mobile / iPad Check
- [ ] UI is readable (text not too small)
- [ ] Buttons are big enough for thumbs (at least 44x44 pixels)
- [ ] Touch controls work smoothly
- [ ] Nothing is hidden behind the Roblox top bar
- [ ] Game runs without lag on iPad
- Ask: "How does it feel on the iPad? Easy to tap buttons? Running smooth?"

### 6. Fun Factor
- [ ] The core loop is satisfying to repeat
- [ ] There's a reason to keep playing
- [ ] Difficulty feels right (not too easy, not too hard)
- Ask: "Is it fun? What's the most fun part? What's the least fun part?"

### 7. Sound & Polish (if applicable)
- [ ] Sounds play at the right time
- [ ] Visual effects look good
- [ ] No placeholder text visible to players

## After Testing
Ask two key questions:
1. "What's the **#1 thing to fix**?" → Create a task for it
2. "What's the **#1 thing to add**?" → Create a task for it

Summarize: "Great playtest session! Here's what we found..." and list the results.

Encourage: "Every playtest makes your game better. Professional game developers do this hundreds of times!"
