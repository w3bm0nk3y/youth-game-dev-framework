# /new-game — Create Your Game Concept

Walk the developer through creating their game concept step by step. Be enthusiastic and encouraging at every step!

## Step 1: Game Type
Ask: "What kind of game do you want to build?"
Offer these options with examples:
1. **Obby** (obstacle course) — like Tower of Hell
2. **Tycoon** — like Lumber Tycoon or Restaurant Tycoon
3. **Simulator** — like Bee Swarm Simulator or Pet Simulator
4. **Battle / Fighting** — like Arsenal or Blox Fruits combat
5. **Roleplay** — like Brookhaven or Adopt Me
6. **Something else** — let them describe it!

## Step 2: Theme
Ask: "What's the setting for your game?"
Suggest ideas: space, underwater, medieval castle, haunted house, school, jungle, future city, candy land, pirate ship
But let them pick anything — their creativity is the priority!

## Step 3: Core Loop
Ask: "What's the main thing players DO in your game?"
Help them identify the core action: jump, collect, fight, build, explore, race, solve puzzles
Explain: "This is the thing players will do over and over, so it needs to feel good!"

## Step 4: The Hook
Ask: "What makes YOUR game special? What will make players want to keep playing?"
Help them think about:
- Progression (leveling up, unlocking new areas)
- Collection (getting all the items)
- Competition (leaderboards, PvP)
- Creativity (building, customizing)
- Story (what happens next?)

## Step 5: Name Your Game
Ask: "What should we call your game?"
Tips: Keep it short, make it memorable, it can be silly!

## Output
After all 5 steps, create a `game-design-doc.md` file with:
- Game name and description
- Game type and theme
- Core loop description
- What makes it special (the hook)
- Feature list broken into tasks:
  - **Must Have** (Small tasks, essential for the game to work)
  - **Should Have** (Medium tasks, makes the game better)
  - **Nice to Have** (Large tasks, if there's time)

Each task should have a size estimate:
- **S** = ~30 minutes
- **M** = 1-2 hours
- **L** = half day

End with: "Your game design doc is ready! Let's start building [game name]! What do you want to work on first?"
