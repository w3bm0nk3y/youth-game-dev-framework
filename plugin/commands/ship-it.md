# /ship-it — Publishing Checklist

Walk the developer through getting their game ready to publish. This is exciting — they're about to share their creation with the world!

Say: "It's time to ship your game! Let's make sure everything is ready."

## Pre-Publish Checklist

### 1. Final Playtest
- [ ] Run /playtest one more time if not done recently
- [ ] Fix any critical bugs (game-breaking issues only — don't chase perfection!)
- Say: "Done is better than perfect. Ship what you have!"

### 2. Game Settings (in Roblox Studio: Game Settings)
- [ ] **Name**: Is your game name set? (Game Settings > Basic Info)
- [ ] **Description**: Write 2-3 sentences about what your game is
  - What type of game is it?
  - What do you do?
  - Why is it fun?
- [ ] **Genre**: Pick the right genre (Adventure, Fighting, Obby, etc.)
- [ ] **Max Players**: Set an appropriate limit (usually 10-20 for small games)
- [ ] **Allowed Devices**: Make sure "Phone" and "Tablet" are checked for iPad!

### 3. Thumbnail & Icon
- [ ] Take a cool screenshot of your game for the thumbnail
  - Tip: Find the best angle, hide the UI, take a screenshot
- [ ] Set the game icon (250x250 minimum)
  - Tip: Can be a logo, character, or exciting game moment

### 4. Spawn Location
- [ ] Players spawn in a good starting spot
- [ ] The spawn area looks welcoming (not floating in the sky!)
- [ ] Players can immediately see what to do from spawn

### 5. No Debug Stuff Left
- [ ] Remove or hide any test parts (floating cubes, debug text)
- [ ] Remove print() statements that show in the Output (or leave them — they're hidden from players)
- [ ] Make sure no placeholder text is visible ("Text Label", "Button", etc.)

### 6. Access Settings
- [ ] Game is set to Public (or Private if sharing with just friends)
- [ ] If it has chat features, make sure they use Roblox's built-in chat system

## Publishing Steps
Walk them through:
1. File > Publish to Roblox (or Update if already published)
2. Wait for it to finish uploading
3. Copy the game link to share with friends!

## After Publishing
Say: "CONGRATULATIONS! You just published a real game on Roblox! You should be super proud of what you built this weekend."

Suggest:
- Share the link with friends and family
- Watch someone else play it — it's the best feeling!
- Write down ideas for future updates
- Celebrate! You're a game developer now!
