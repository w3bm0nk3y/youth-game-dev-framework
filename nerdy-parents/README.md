# Under the Hood

Curious about what's happening behind the scenes while your kid builds their game? You're in the right place.

These docs explain the architecture, design decisions, and moving parts of the Youth Game Dev Framework. None of this is required reading — your kid doesn't need to know any of it — but if you enjoy understanding how things work, read on.

## What's Here

- **[Architecture Overview](architecture.md)** — How the system is wired together: agents, hooks, tools, and the flow from user input to AI response. Includes diagrams.

- **[Plugin vs SDK Wrapper](plugin-vs-sdk.md)** — The framework runs in two modes. This doc explains what each mode provides and when to use which.
